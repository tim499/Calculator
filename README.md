# Calculator. Release of v.0.1

## Description of condition

This repository presents a console calculator written in pure C.
The calculator is still quite raw and the program is not yet ready to be
installed on other systems.
Version 1.0 will be finalized soon.

## How it works

This calculator can work in two modes: standard and converter mode.
In standard mode, the calculator can perform 6 operations:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, addition to degree
and square root extraction.
